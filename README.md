# Project Setup and Testing Instructions

This project consists of a Backend and Frontend that need to be run simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: Latest LTS version)
- npm (Comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the Backend directory:
   ```
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The backend server should now be running on its configured port.

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a **new terminal** (keep the Backend terminal running) and navigate to the Frontend directory:
   ```
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The frontend application should now be running and will be accessible via your browser at the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173 or similar).

## Important Notes

- Make sure the Backend server is running before starting the Frontend
- Keep both terminal windows open during development
- Any changes made to the code will automatically reload the respective server/application
